# ADC-with-TM4C123GXL
This project teaches about the TI LaunchPad's ADC. You'll sample ADC channel 1, store results in a variable, and turn on LEDs based on a potentiometer's voltage. Use the JTAG debugger to view stored results. This project enhances knowledge of ADC and controlling digital outputs via analog inputs.
